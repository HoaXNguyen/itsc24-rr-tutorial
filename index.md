Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific research, providing the foundation for validating results and advancing knowledge. In research fields where computation-based scientific publication is pervasive, a credibility crisis has been warned [2]. Reproducible Research (RR) is gaining extensive attention in various fields, such as remote sensing, medicine, and data science, to ensure the validity and reliability of scientific findings.

In the field of traffic and transportation, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) represent the most computationally intensive, fast-growing area of research with significant implications of outcomes for the general population. In ITS, the rapid evolution of technologies and methodologies has emphasized the need for RR practices. Reproducibility can refer to computational reproducibility, ensuring that the same data and analysis steps produce consistent results. However, when it is infeasible to replicate an entire scientific study, achieving reproducibility sets a minimum standard of scientific rigor by allowing others to validate and build upon the findings. With ITS being inherently interdisciplinary and data-driven, reproducibility forms the backbone for credible, reliable research outputs.

The objectives of the tutorial:
- An introduction to the fundamental concepts and importance of RR to the domain of ITS 
- Provide hands-on training in the use of tools and software that facilitate reproducibility
- Guide researchers on how to properly document and organize data and project outcomes to foster open science
- Encourage collaboration among tutorial participants and the broader ITS community to foster a community that values and practices reproducible research

#### Discussion Topics

- **Benchmarks**: What benchmark environments will help the community better measure the progress of TAMP and integrate learning with TAMP?
- **Large Language Models for Task Planning**: LLM has shown promise in generalizable task planning. What are the potentials and challenges in integrating LLM with TAMP?
- **Perception**: Perception in TAMP and the latest developments in this area, including 3D computer vision, open-world recognition, and sensor fusion.
- **Error Recovery / Closed-Loop TAMP**: Techniques and principles that allow TAMP to be more robust and recover from errors and interventions.
- **Skill Learning / Manipulation**: Skill learning and manipulation for TAMP, including but not limited to deep reinforcement learning and imitation learning. How do we make the learned skills generalizable and composable?
- **Model Learning**: Techniques and principles for learning discrete or continuous transition models from interaction data.

    <td>Session 1: Introduction to Reproducible Research

Objective: The participants will be able to identify issues that RR aims to solve. They will also learn how to pinpoint challenges in making analyses reproducible.

Brief description: The introductory session will lay the groundwork for understanding the essential role of reproducibility in scientific research and specifically to transportation research. We'll start by defining reproducibility and explaining its significance in scientific research, focusing on how it underpins the validity and credibility of the findings in the field of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). The reproducibility crisis will be discussed in light of its implications, such as hindrance to scientific progress, resource wastage, and diminished public trust in research outcomes. Further, we'll explore the relevance of reproducibility to ITS research, citing examples from traffic management systems to autonomous vehicle technology.

The hands-on activity will focus on participants identifying some issues related to making transportation research reproducible [9]. We will also conduct a survey to assess attitudes towards RR and needs of the community.
